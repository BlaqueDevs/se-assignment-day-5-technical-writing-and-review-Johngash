    Diagrams are best for explainig systems and processes
    Flowcharts are best for step by step processes
    Infographics are best for summarizing key information

    Screenshots and GIFs are best for software tutorials

## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?

    Improve reading by breaking up text, enhance organization and logical flow, improve navigation as readers can jump to relevant sections quickly
